<!-- Thanksgiving homework.  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- If you haven't finished the two PDF's: Your homework is to solve all problems from the PDFs and fully understand the simplest app.  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- If you're done with the first and need the 2nd or if you need the simplest app project, please email Oren at og@turntotech.io  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- If you're done with the PDF's and not completed the 'Simplest App', please work on that. That project is what your iOS foundation will be built on. -->
<!--  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- For everyone else: -->
<!--  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- 1. You have a sentence i.e. a string of words with some punctuation (such as a comma or hyphen).  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Task: Reverse the order of words so the last word comes first and so on. But make sure the punctuation is in the same position.  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- 2. Implement your own Set class. The key idea behind a set is that it never allows duplicates. Support the following  -->
<!-- A. Add object  -->
<!-- B. Remove object  -->
<!-- C. Count number of objects  -->
<!-- D. Get all objects  -->
<!-- E. Restrict the type of objects that can be added. This can be done by adding an initializer or constructor that sets the type of objects allowed. You can use the class name for this.  -->
<!-- F. If an object of an incorrect type is added, it should throw an exception of a custom type. Should not crash.  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Example : Java -->
<!--  -->
<!-- If you only want strings, you can do something like this  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- MySet s = new MySet("java.lang.String"); -->
<!--  -->
<!-- 3. Create a countdown timer app. You should be able to set the duration from the app. It stood visually count-down and and ring an alarm when done.  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- 4. Programmatically create the chessboard pattern in a single screen app -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Example: objective-c:  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- MySet * s = [ [MySet alloc] initWithType:@"NSString"]; -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Example : Swift -->
<!--  -->
<!-- var s = MySet("String") -->
<!--  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- 5. If all this was too easy - go back to all the quizzes that you didn't get a chance to complete and try those. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- And if you need even more things to practice - try this -->

1. Learn the merge sort algorithm and implement it without referring to the Internet or a book. Use paper and pen for this.

2. Learn about the Big-O notation. How does merge sort compare to bubble sort?

3. Write an app that demonstrates the effect of setNeedsDisplay (iOS) or invalidateView() method (Android). i.e. run with and without these calls and the difference should be clear.
